# Behavioral Analytics under Risk Contexts  
**Modeling Consumer Decisions: Cognitive Dissonance, Psychological Reactance, and Fear**

This repository presents a research project that analyzes how **cognitive dissonance**, **psychological reactance**, and **fear** influence consumer information-seeking and dining behaviors under COVID-19 risk contexts. The study employs a **data-driven behavioral modeling** approach using survey-based constructs and **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)**.

## Overview

This research examines **consumer responses to dining-out risks** during COVID-19 by modeling how conflicting cognitions generate emotional reactions—fear and reactance—which subsequently shape information behaviors and dining decisions.

Key contributions include:
- Differentiating emotional pathways (**fear vs. psychological reactance**)  
- Identifying how each pathway affects **information seeking** and **information avoidance**  
- Providing insights for **risk communication**, **public health messaging**, and **restaurant management** under crisis conditions

## Research Model

The structural model evaluates directional effects among:
- **Cognitive variables** → dissonance  
- **Emotional responses** → fear & reactance  
- **Information behavior** → seeking vs. avoidance  
- **Behavioral intention** → preventive vs. general dining decisions

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Constructed composite variables from Likert-scale survey items  
- Conducted measurement refinement through item deletion  

### 2. Reliability & Validity  
- Cronbach’s α > 0.70 across constructs  

### 3. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)  
- Demonstrated strong model fit (CFI = .921, TLI = .903, RMSEA = .056)

### 4. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)  
- Estimated hypothesized cognitive → emotional → behavioral pathways  
- Performed significance testing on all direct and indirect effects

## Key Findings

### Cognitive → Emotional  
- Cognitive dissonance increases **fear**  
- Cognitive dissonance increases **psychological reactance**

### Emotional → Information Behavior  
- Fear → increases information seeking; decreases information avoidance  
- Reactance → increases information avoidance; does not significantly affect seeking  

### Information Behavior → Dining Intention  
- Seeking → increases preventive behavior; decreases general dining  
- Avoidance → decreases preventive behavior; increases general dining  

**Summary:**  
> Fear motivates constructive engagement, while reactance triggers withdrawal and avoidance.
