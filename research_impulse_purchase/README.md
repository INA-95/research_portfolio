# Impulsive Purchase Behavior Analysis  
**Modeling Impulsive Buying through Lifestyle Factors and In-Store Stimuli**

This repository contains a research project analyzing how various consumer lifestyle factors influence impulsive purchasing behavior under different in-store stimuli (Atmosphere, Packaging, POP Advertising).  
The study integrates **psychological constructs**, **quantitative modeling**, and **data science methodology**.

## Overview  

Impulsive purchasing is an emotionally driven behavior often triggered by sensory cues and store environments.  
This project takes a **data-driven behavioral modeling** approach using:

- **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)** → Extracting underlying lifestyle dimensions  
- **Multiple Regression Analysis** → Predicting impulsive buying under various stimuli  
- **Likert-scale measurements** for all constructs  
- **Quantitative modeling pipeline** applicable to broader data science workflows

## Research Model  

**Lifestyle → (Atmosphere / Packaging / POP Advertising) → Impulsive Purchasing**

This model integrates psychographic segmentation with environmental marketing variables to predict impulsive buying tendencies.

## Methodology  

### 1) **Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA)**  
Extracted six lifestyle factors:

| Lifestyle Factor       | Explained Variance (%) | Cronbach’s α |
|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Stimulation-Seeking    | 11.333                 | 0.791        |
| Trend-Seeking          | 9.244                  | 0.846        |
| Self-Creative          | 8.880                  | 0.852        |
| Self-Expressive        | 8.838                  | 0.723        |
| Principle-Exploring    | 8.724                  | 0.771        |
| Learning-Seeking       | 7.229                  | 0.554        |

### 2) **Multiple Regression Analysis**  
Examined how each lifestyle factor predicts impulsive purchasing under:

- **Store Atmosphere**
- **Packaging**
- **POP Advertising**

Standardized β coefficients were used to evaluate the relative importance of predictors.

## Key Findings  

### Stimulation-Seeking → Strongest Predictor  
Across all conditions, stimulation-seeking consumers—those sensitive to sensory cues—showed the highest impulsive purchasing tendencies.

### Self-Creative & Self-Expressive → Strong sensitivity to visual/creative stimuli  
- POP Advertising: Self-creative exhibited the highest effect (β = 0.266)  
- Packaging: Self-expressive showed significant influence

### Principle-Exploring & Learning-Seeking → Least impulsive  
These groups favor logical, informational cues over emotional or sensory-based triggers.

## Conclusion  

This research bridges **behavioral psychology** and **data science** by incorporating latent lifestyle constructs into predictive models of impulsive purchasing.  
It demonstrates how **data-driven retail personalization** can target consumer segments based on lifestyle orientation.
